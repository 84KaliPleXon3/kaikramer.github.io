<h1>About Keys</h1>
<hr />

A Key contains a single symmetric cryptographic key. Key entries are represented
in KeyStore Explorer by the following icon:

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
    src="images/key_entry.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Key entries are protected by a password. In KeyStore Explorer such entries are
  described as being <b>Locked</b> and have a closed padlock displayed against
  them:
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
    src="images/locked_entry.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  To access the key the entry must be
  <a href="unlockKey.html"><b>Unlocked</b></a>
  by supplying the correct password. If an entry is successfully unlocked then
  an open padlock is displayed against it:
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
    src="images/unlocked_entry.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  If a Key Pair entry is unlocked once during a KeyStore Explorer session it
  does not need to be unlocked again. A Key Pair entry may be unlocked
  explicitly or as part of an operation that requires the private key.
</p>
<p>
  As key entries do not contain any certificates no value is shown for them in
  the
  <b>Certificate Expiry</b> column of the KeyStore table.
</p>
