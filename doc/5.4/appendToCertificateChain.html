<h1>Append to Certificate Chain</h1>
<hr />

To append a certificate to the end of a Key Pair's Certificate Chain:

<ol>
  <li>
    Right-click on the Key Pair entry in the KeyStore Entries table. Select the
    <b>Edit Certificate Chain</b> sub-menu from the pop-up menu and from there
    choose <b>Append Certificate</b>.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    If required the <b>Unlock Entry</b> dialog will be displayed. Enter the Key
    Pair entry's password and press the <b>OK</b> button.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>The <b>Append Certificate</b> dialog will appear.</li>

  <br />

  <li>
    Select the drive and folder where the certificate file to be appended is
    stored.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    Click on the required certificate file or type the filename into the
    <b>File Name</b> text box.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>Click on the <b>Append</b> button.</li>

  <br />

  <li>
    For the append to succeed, the chosen certificate's private key must have
    been used to sign the end certificate of the chain. An indication that this
    is the case is if the chosen certificate's subject is identical to the end
    certificate's issuer.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    If the append is successful the Key Pair entry's certificate chain will be
    updated to include the appended certificate.
  </li>
</ol>
