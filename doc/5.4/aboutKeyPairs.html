<h1>About Key Pairs</h1>
<hr />

A Key Pair contains a private key and its associated certificate chain. Key
Pairs can be used to digitally sign objects such as Java applications. Key Pair
entries are represented in KeyStore Explorer by the following icon:

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
    src="images/keypair_entry.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  As the private key part of the Key Pair should remain secret, Key Pair entries
  are normally protected by a password. In KeyStore Explorer such entries are
  described as being <b>Locked</b> and have a closed padlock displayed against
  them:
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
    src="images/locked_entry.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  To access the private key the entry must be
  <a href="unlockKeyPair.html"><b>Unlocked</b></a>
  by supplying the correct password. If an entry is successfully unlocked then
  an open padlock is displayed against it:
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
    src="images/unlocked_entry.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  If a Key Pair entry is unlocked once during a KeyStore Explorer session it
  does not need to be unlocked again. A Key Pair entry may be unlocked
  explicitly or as part of an operation that requires the private key.
</p>
<p>
  A Key Pair must be unlocked to utilize it for operations such as digital
  signing or to view or export the private key.
