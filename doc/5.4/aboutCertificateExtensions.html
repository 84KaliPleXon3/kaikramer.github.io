<h1>About Certificate Extensions</h1>
<hr />

Certificate extensions can be <a href="addCertificateExtensions.html">added</a>
to Version 3 X.509 certificates during
<a href="generateKeyPair.html">Key Pair generation</a> or when
<a href="signCsr.html">signing a CSR</a>. Extensions allow extra attributes to
be attached to the certificate.

<p>
  KeyStore Explorer supports the addition of most of the set of extensions
  specified in RFC 5280 (Certificate Profile) and the Netscape Certificate
  Extensions. See <a href="specifications.html">Specifications</a> for details
  of supported certificate extensions.
</p>
<p>
  The RFC 5280 extensions tend to be complex structures. See the
  <b>Certificate Extensions</b> section of the RFC document
  <b>Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile</b> for specific
  details. This document is freely available on the internet. The Netscape set
  of extensions are simpler and their specifics are documented generally on the
  web.
