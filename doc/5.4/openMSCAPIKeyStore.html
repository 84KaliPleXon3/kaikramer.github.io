        <h1>Open the Windows User KeyStore</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
        Since Java 6 the SunMSCAPI provider is part of the JRE, enabling software written in Java to access the native
        cryptographic services and key containers of the Windows platform.
        </p>

        <p>
        In KeyStore Explorer you can open the "Windows-MY" KeyStore, which contains the user's personal certificates
        and associated private keys.
        </p>

        <p>
        To open the Windows-MY KeyStore:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Open Special</b> and from the
                sub-menu <b>Open Windows-MY</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The Windows-MY KeyStore will appear as an additional tab.</li>

            </ol>
        </ol>

        <p>
        Note that due to restrictions of the SunMSCAPI provider not all features are available, that would be available
        for other keystore types.
        </p>
