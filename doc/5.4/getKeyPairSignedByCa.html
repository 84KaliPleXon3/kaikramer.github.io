<h1>Get a Key Pair Signed by a CA (Certificate Authority)</h1>
<hr />

To get a Key Pair signed by a CA:

<ol>
  <li>First <a href="createNewKeyStore.html">create a new KeyStore</a>.</li>

  <br />

  <li>
    Either
    <a href="importKeyPairPkcs12.html">import an existing Key Pair</a> into the
    KeyStore or <a href="generateKeyPair.html">generate a new Key Pair</a> in
    the KeyStore.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    Next <a href="generateCsr.html">generate a CSR</a> (Certificate Signing
    Request) file from the Key Pair.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    Send the CSR file to a CA for signing. Each CA has different procedures for
    signing certificates and will charge a fee. Check the CA's web site for
    details.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    The CA will send back a CA Reply. This will most likely take the form of a
    file with the extension p7r or cer.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    <a href="importCaReply.html">Import the CA Reply</a> into the original Key
    Pair.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    The Key Pair has now been signed by the CA.
    <a href="viewKeyPairCertificateChain.html"
      >View the Key Pair's certificate chain</a
    >. Your certificate, at the end of the chain, will contain the CA's details
    in the issuer field.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>Finally <a href="saveKeyStore.html">save the KeyStore</a>.</li>
</ol>
