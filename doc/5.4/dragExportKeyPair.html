<h1>Drag Export a Key Pair</h1>
<hr />

To drag export a Key Pair:

<ol>
  <li>
    Ensure the Key Pair entry is <a href="unlockKeyPair.html">Unlocked</a>.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    Select the Key Pair entry for dragging by pressing and holding the left
    mouse button over it in the KeyStore entries table.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    Use the mouse to drag the entry to the desired export location. For example:
    the desktop, a folder or a text editor.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>Release the left mouse button over the export location.</li>

  <br />

  <li>
    The entry will be exported. The export format used depends on the export
    location:
  </li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      When exporting as a file the export format is <b>PKCS #12</b>. This is
      applicable when the entry is dragged to the desktop or to a folder.
    </li>

    <br />

    <li>
      When exporting as text the export is in two parts. The private key is
      exported as Encrypted <b>PKCS #8 PEM</b> and the certificate chain is
      exported as <b>PKCS #7 PEM</b>. This is applicable when the entry is
      dragged to an application that deals with text.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <li>
    Exports that are password protected inherit the password of the originating
    Key Pair entry.
  </li>
</ol>
