<h1>About KeyStores</h1>
<hr />

KeyStore Explorer can be used to <a href="createNewKeyStore.html">create</a>,
edit and <a href="saveKeyStore.html">save</a> KeyStore files. A KeyStore is a
storage mechanism for cryptographic tokens. Such tokens are known as entries.
KeyStore entries can be one of the following types:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="aboutTrustedCertificates.html">Trusted Certificate</a>
    Contains a single public key certificate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="aboutKeyPairs.html">Key Pair</a>
    Holds a private key and its associated chain of one or more certificates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="aboutKeys.html">Key</a>
    Contains a single cryptographic key.
  </li>
</ul>

Each entry in a KeyStore is identified by a different alias or entry name.
Entries also store their last modified date/time.

<p>
  KeyStores are password protected. The password is required to load the
  KeyStore and a password will be requested when saving a KeyStore for the first
  time.
</p>

<p>
  Key Pair entries are also password protected. A password is required to access
  the private key part of a Key Pair entry.
</p>

<p>
  There are various different types of KeyStore supported by KeyStore Explorer:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>JKS</b>
    Java KeyStore. Oracle's KeyStore format.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>JCEKS</b>
    Java Cryptography Extension KeyStore. More secure version of JKS.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>PKCS #12</b>
    Public-Key Cryptography Standards #12 KeyStore. RSA's KeyStore format.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>BKS</b>
    Bouncy Castle KeyStore. Bouncy Castle's version of JKS.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>BKS-V1</b>
    Older and incompatible version of Bouncy Castle KeyStore.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>UBER</b>
    Bouncy Castle UBER KeyStore. More secure version of BKS.
  </li>
</ul>

All of the KeyStores operate identically when managed with KeyStore Explorer
with the exception of PKCS #12 KeyStores. Unlike other KeyStore types, PKCS #12
KeyStores do not store the last modified date and time of entries. When viewing
a PKCS #12 KeyStore the <b>Last Modified</b> column will always be blank.
