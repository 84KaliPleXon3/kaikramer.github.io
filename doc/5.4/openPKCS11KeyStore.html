title: KSE Manual - Open a PKCS#11 KeyStore
---

<h1>Open a PKCS#11 KeyStore</h1>
<hr />

<p>
  PKCS#11 is a standard that defines an API for accessing cryptographic devices.
  In Java the SunPKCS11 provider wraps the PKCS#11 API and transforms it into
  the keystore API.
</p>

<p>
  To open a PKCS#11 KeyStore:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    From the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Open Special</b> and from the sub-menu
    <b>Open PKCS#11</b>.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    The <b>Open PKCS#11</b> dialog will appear. There are two ways to use a
    PKCS#11 library in KSE:
  </li>

  <ol>
    <li>
      If the SunPKCS11 provider has already been added to the Java Security
      properties file (this is described in detail in the
      <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html"
        >Java PKCS#11 Reference Guide</a
      >
      and also often in the documentation of the cryptographic device), then you
      can then simply select it in this dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
      Alternatively, KSE can register the SunPKCS11 provider itself, if you
      provide the path to the PKCS#11 library and the right slot index.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Press the <b>OK</b> button when you have selected one of the two methods.
  </p>

  <br />

  <li>Type in the KeyStore's password and press the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

  <br />

  <li>The PKCS#11 KeyStore will appear as an additional tab.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Note that because PKCS#11 libraries are native code you have to make sure that
  both the JRE and the PKCS#11 library are either 32 or 64 bit.
</p>
