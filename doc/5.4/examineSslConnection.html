  </li>

  <br />

  <li>The <b>Examine SSL</b> dialog will appear.</li>

  <br />

    Enter the <b>SSL Host</b> and <b>Port</b> of the connection to be examined.
    Your last ten input values are saved and available via the drop down box.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>
    Optionally you can activate <b>client authentication</b>. You have just to
    select a KeyStore and the private key from KeyStore is used to authenticate
    against the SSL server. If there is more than one private key in the
    KeyStore that could be used for client authentication, then standard Java
    mechanisms are used to find the right one.
  </li>

  <br />

  <li>Click on the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

  <br />

  <li>The <b>Certificate Details for SSL Connection</b> dialog will appear.</li>

  <br />

    <b>OK</b> button.
